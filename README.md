### Project Overview
---
This is an assignment given based on Pivot data, where I was tasked to;

1. Create a 10-15 visual report from the data shared for the pivot data

2. Document your step by step analysis from the Data given.

3. Tell a compelling story sharing business insight to drive a successful business decisions

### Data Sources
---
The data used for this assignment was shared by the facilator for SkilHarvest Data Analysis class.
Dataset has 10 columns and 30,800 rows

### Tools Used
---
- MS Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    1. This is the major tool used for analysis
 
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
The data shared had already been cleaned.
I expanded columns and checked for duplicates.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA Checklist:
1. Summary Statistics: Understand basic metrics (sum, max, count).
2. Visualizations: Use charts (bar charts, area graphs, pie charts, line graphs to visually explore data.
3. Categorical Data: Summarize and visualize categorical variables.

### Data Analysis
---
Excel Function (IF Function)
This was used to calculate the Sales Category
```
=IF(J4<=20,"LOW",IF(J4<=50,"MEDIUM",IF(J4>50,"HIGH")))
```
### Results/Insights
---
From the data shared and the charts created;
1. The sum of revenue in the different regions, stores and market was analysed which amounted to 73.03B

2. Profit generation shows that the year 2014 had better sales compared to 2015.
Total Sales in 2014: 48.46B
Total Sales in 2015: 28.57B
The low sales in 2015 was due to the fact that the revenue was only generated from Jan to July,
whereas 2014 had revenue which ran through the entire months of the year.

4. There were four distinct lines of business;
   - Service Plan
   - Printer Sales
   - Parts
   - Copier Sale

6. There were also five distinct Day Category;
   - Work day
   - Local holiday
   - Observance
   - Season
   - Public holiday
  
7. The total number of stores is 132
8. There were 9 different models

### Business Decisions
---
1. Unique Regional Strategies: A region-specific strategy can be adopted. High-performing regions (e.g., North East) made great revenue, while regions (e.g., the North-Central) had low revenue. This can enable all regions to be equally focsed on.

2. Capitalizing on the Day Category: From the charts, we analysed that the Work day had the highest number markets and the Local holiday had the least, this implies the work day will have higher revenue.

### Key Points:
1. Understanding regional performance and adapting strategies to specific stores can unlock hidden growth potential.
2. Focusing on high-margin products and understanding market-specific demands can significantly improve store performance.
3. Understanding the seasons can drive customer engagement and maximize revenue.

### Problem Statement
This report contains the analysis of the dataset, It is concerned with the regional sales with respect to revenue generated from specific markets and stores in different regions.
The Charts shows insight into the relationship between different columns.
